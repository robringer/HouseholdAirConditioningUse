The data were obtained from the North America Regional Renanalysis (NARR). 

Variables included Discomfort Index (DI), Heat Index (HIA), Humidity Index (HUMIDEX), simfilified wet bulb temperature (sWBGT), air temperature at 2m (tas), dew point temperature (TDEW), and wet bulb temperature (WBA).
Data are daily average values across the 27 RECS domains (see geographicdomains.xlsx for IDs), which were later aggregated to monthly values. Data were collected from 2005 through 2019. 
Units: DI = degrees Celcius, HIA = none, HUMIDEX = none, sWBGT = degrees Celcius, tas = Kelvin, TDEW = Kelvin, WBA = degrees Celcius
