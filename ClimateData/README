Climate data were obtained from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and the CMIP5 suite of global climate models. 

Variables included Discomfort Index (DI), Heat Index (HIA), Humidity Index (HUMIDEX), simfilified wet bulb temperature (sWBGT), air temperature at 2m (tas), dew point temperature (TDEW), and wet bulb temperature (WBA).
Units: DI = degrees Celcius, HIA = none, HUMIDEX = none, sWBGT = degrees Celcius, tas = Kelvin, TDEW = Kelvin, WBA = degrees Celcius

Data were obtained for each day from January 2007 through December 2019.
