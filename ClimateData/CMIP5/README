Data were obtained from the CMIP5 suite of future climate model simulations, intitially run by the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling.
The simulation data used here were obtained from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP; https://www.isimip.org/).

Variables included Discomfort Index (DI), Heat Index (HIA), Humidity Index (HUMIDEX), simfilified wet bulb temperature (sWBGT), air temperature at 2m (tas), dew point temperature (TDEW), and wet bulb temperature (WBA).
Data are monthly average values across the 27 RECS domains (see geographicdomains.xlsx for IDs). Data were collected from 1950 through 2099. 
Units: DI = degrees Celcius, HIA = none, HUMIDEX = none, sWBGT = degrees Celcius, tas = Kelvin, TDEW = Kelvin, WBA = degrees Celcius

Each variable (DI, HIA, HUMIDEX, sWBGT, tas, TDEW, WBA) has its own folder. Within each folder are files (.csv) for each climate model considered in this study: 
- Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory - Earth Systems Model (GFDL-ESM2M)
- Hadley Centre Global Environment Model (HadGEM2-ES)
- Institut Pierre Simon Laplace Model (IPSL-CM5A-LR)
- Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate - Earth Systems Model (MIROC-ESM-CHEM)
- Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM1-M)
