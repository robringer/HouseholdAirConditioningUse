# HouseholdAirConditioningUse

Code and data for an analysis of household air conditioning use across the United States. The results from the analysis are currently under review: 

Obringer, R., Maia-Silva, D., CR, V., Nateghi, R., Mukherjee, S., McRoberts, D.B., and Kumar, R. Anthropogenic warming threatens sustainable household air conditioning consumption across the United States. 

The code was developed in R version 4.0.2 and last ran on 22 April 2021. The code can be found in the 'rcode' folder and the associated Rdata files can be found in the 'rdatafiles' folder. 

Two categories of data were collected: utility data and climate data. The utility data (folder: 'UtilityData') includes air conditioning use data obtained from the US Energy Information Administration. The climate data (folder: 'ClimateData') were obtained from the North American Regional Reanalysis and the CMIP5 suite of global climate models. All data were collected in 2020.
