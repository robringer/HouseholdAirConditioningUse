R code associated with the household air conditioning project. 

Files 02A_PopulationDataProcessing.R, 03A_bart_package_cross_validation.R, and 03B_bart_package_vimp.R are not executable, but should be downloaded to the same directory as the other code files.

Code should be ran in the following order: 
01_Process_InputData_ClimateVariables.R --> 02_Process_InputData_ElectricitySales.R --> 03.1_Model_Creation_bart.R --> 
05_SamplingDistributionGeneration.R --> 06.1_Projected_FractionalConsumption.allvars.R --> 07_Miscellaneous.R

Code was last run on 30 April 2021 using R v4.0.2.

Explanations of each file: 

01_Process_InputData_ClimateVariables.R - Load climate variables (observations and future) and aggregate to monthly values where necessary.
02_Process_InputData_ElectricitySales.R - Load electricity use data and go through pre-processing steps (aggregation and de-trending).
02A_PopulationDataProcessing.R - Load and process population data. * This file is called within 02_Process_InputData_ElectricitySales.R *
03.1_Model_Creation_bart.R - Build BART model and predict total monthly electricity use.
03A_bart_package_cross_validation.R - Cross validation function for BART. * This file is called within 03.1_Model_Creation_bart.R *
03B_bart_package_vimp.R - Variable importance function for BART. * This file is called within 03.1_Model_Creation_bart.R *
05_SamplingDistributionGeneration.R - Generate sampling distribution for air conditioning demand obtained from EIA RECS.
06.1_Projected_FractionalConsumption.allvars.R - Project air conditioning demand into the future. 
07_Miscellaneous.R - Plotting and other miscellaneous calcuations.
